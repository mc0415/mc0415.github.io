        My research examines the role of Artificial Intelligence in Emergency Communication Centers, with a focus on how these technologies affect operational performance and the delivery of critical public services. 

        More broadly, my interests lie at the intersection of AI, operations management, and public safety systems operating under high-stakes conditions.
