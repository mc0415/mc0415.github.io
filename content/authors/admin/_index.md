## About Me

I am a PhD Candidate at McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin. I work with Prof.[Ioannis Stamatopoulos](https://sites.utexas.edu/yannis-stamos/) and Prof.[Hale Erkan](https://search.asu.edu/profile/4821648). I am interested in empirical operations management and the way artificial intelligence is transforming operations in public safety and law enforcement.
